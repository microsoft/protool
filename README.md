[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/protool.svg)](https://github.com/Microsoft/protool/blob/master/LICENSE)

A tool for dealing with provisioning profiles.

What can it do? 

* Read profiles as XML or as a dictionary
* Read the values from the profile
* Diff two profiles to see what has changed

### Installation



    pip install protool

### Examples:

    import protool
    profile = protool.ProvisioningProfile("/path/to/profile")

    # Get the diff of two profiles
    diff = protool.diff("/path/to/first", "/path/to/second", tool_override="diff")

    # Get the UUID of a profile
    print profile.uuid

    # Get the full XML of the profile
    print profile.xml

    # Get the parsed contents of the profile as a dictionary
    print profile.contents()


Alternatively, from the command line:

    # Get the diff
    protool diff --profiles /path/to/profile1 /path/to/profile2 --tool diff

    # Get the UUID of a profile
    protool read --profile /path/to/profile --key UUID

    # Get the raw XML (identical to using `security cms -D -i /path/to/profile`)
    protool decode --profile /path/to/profile
